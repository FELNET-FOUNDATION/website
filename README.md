## 🌐 Our Mission

To create an accessible, resilient, and private internet infrastructure by utilizing untapped network resources across the globe, making connectivity available in regions with limited access while enhancing privacy and security for all users.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Unused Data Utilization**: Transform idle data packages and WiFi networks into shared resources
- **DVPN Security**: Decentralized Virtual Private Network technology ensuring private and secure connections
- **Global Access**: Bridge the digital divide by connecting underserved regions
- **Resource Optimization**: Make use of underutilized bandwidth that would otherwise go to waste
- **User Privacy**: Enhanced privacy protection compared to traditional centralized networks
- **Network Resilience**: Distributed architecture provides greater reliability and fault tolerance

## 🔧 How It Works

FELNET operates on a simple yet powerful concept:

1. **Resource Sharing**: Users can share their unused data or connect to the network
2. **Decentralized Routing**: Traffic is routed through multiple nodes in the network
3. **DVPN Technology**: All connections are encrypted and secure
4. **Fair Compensation**: Contributors receive incentives for sharing resources
5. **Global Mesh**: The network grows stronger with each new participant

## 🚀 Getting Started

> **Note**: FELNET is currently in development phase. Join our waitlist for early access.

### Prerequisites

- A compatible device (mobile phone, laptop, or IoT device)
- Internet connection (to initially join the network)
- FELNET application (coming soon)

### Installation

1. Sign up for early access at [felnet.io](https://felnet.io)
2. Once invited, download the FELNET application
3. Create your secure account
4. Configure your sharing preferences
5. Connect to the decentralized network

## 📊 Technical Architecture

FELNET's architecture consists of three primary layers:

1. **User Layer**: Client applications for end-users to access and contribute to the network
2. **Node Layer**: Distributed nodes that handle routing, verification, and data transfer
3. **Protocol Layer**: The underlying DVPN technology that ensures security and efficiency
